        <p class="aboutmuseum">
          The Rodin Museum is a popular attraction located at the 
          heart of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The museum holds countless collections of 
          Auguste Rodin’s works. These works include sculptures of varying sizes, drawings, 
          paintings and studies. The museum also has a garden, attracting quite a lot of 
          visitors throughout the year. Some of Rodin’s most famous works are in this museum: 
          The Thinker, The Gates of Hell, and more. </p>

          PROBLEM STATEMENT
          </h5>
          <p class="problemstate">
            Rodin’s works are described to be quite bold and intense. Unfortunately, the 
            museum’s website did not reflect the tremendous, beautiful works that were 
            stored in the physical museum. As mentioned, the amount of white space that 
            created a thick border around the actual content had to be improved upon. To 
            further, it wasn’t difficult to notice how colorless the overall website was 
            as well. There were colors added from the images of the museum itself, but 
            everything else that users would have to interact with was white. Simply put, 
            the website was bland and boring. If the user were to delve deeper into the 
            website, they would find artwork descriptions in white font color on top of a 
            black background. This is still a very bland and minimal color use and transition. 
            Not to mention, the typography was disappointing. There was not much engaging 
            about the content, aside from all the images. One final problem to note about 
            the original website was how difficult it was for users to get from one page 
            to the next desired page. My goal for this project was to develop an aesthetic 
            interface that would keep users engaged as they interacted with the website. 
            This would ultimately lead them to be able to obtain information about the 
            museum and even be able to learn about Rodin’s works on the website.

            USERS & AUDIENCE
          </h5>
          <p class="users_aud">
            To confirm my initial theories about users wanting to or not wanting to continue 
            using the website, I conducted quick interviews with people who have never seen 
            the website. Along with the initial interviews I conducted, I also researched to 
            see what age groups were more likely to attend museums and the reasons why. 
            Briefly, older people were more open to visit museums at their leisure. Young 
            adults and even teenagers visit museums mostly for educational purposes or for 
            family vacations. At the very least, because most users would be in their early 
            20’s and older, I wanted to carefully decide upon which color theme and which 
            typography arrangement to use for the website.

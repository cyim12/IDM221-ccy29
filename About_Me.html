    <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello! My name is Christine.</p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Hello! My name is Christine Yim and I am a second year, Interactive Digital Media student at the 
Westphal College of Media Arts and Design of Drexel University. I am currently expanding my knowledge 
in the field with the help of many professional and student mentors. 
        </p>

          I have a creative side to my personality, which helps me to think outside the box and ultimately 
design and produce works that I am most proud of. In terms of work ethics, I am able to focus hard on 
school work in a corner by myself as much as I am able to focus with groups of friends at a cafe. The 
balance in being able to work in two completely different settings helped me to realize how productive 
I could be at a job meant for both individual work and teamwork. Other than that, I enjoy the processes 
of thinking, organizing, managing, and communicating.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          I am a music lover as it is the one thing that helps me push through any busy day. Whether it be classical, indie-pop, hip-hop, 
or jazz, I can find peace in whichever setting I am in, as long as I listen to music. 
I also love rain, which quite the unpopular opinion. I am able 
to sit by the window and watch the rain pour while I do anything to keep my hands busy. Lastly, going to 
New York City is my all time favorite hobby. My hometown is right across the George Washington Bridge, 
making it easy for me to visit the city whenever I can. The busy and constantly changing environment is a 
source of energy for me. I hope to move to New York once I score a job there as well.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Now looking forward, I really aim to continue to find things that I love but also want to give back to 
the community. For that reason, I have joined two additional clubs at Drexel University this year, Global 
Medical Missions Alliance and Drexelâ€™s UNICEF. Knowing that I am able to help the less fortunate only motivates 
me to do so much more. Since I am only a student whose main goal is to excel academically in preparation for 
the professional world, I can only do so much. However, I really hope to continue to adapt this mindset of understanding 
my privilege and what I can do with that privilege to help others.
